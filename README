libal5poly is basically a polymorphic game framework built on Allegro 5.
It is intended to be abstract enough to support multiple backends, but
Allegro 5 is the only planned backend at this time. The name may change if
that changes. Currently it is very simple. It was originally written as an
example of program design for a thread on the http://www.allegro.cc/
forums.

It's not really ready for public use yet, but it is licensed under the
terms of the GNU GPL version 2 or higher; so you may use it under those
terms if you want.

Documentation is nonexistent because it's a WIP... xD
